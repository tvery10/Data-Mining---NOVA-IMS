# Data Mining – NOVA IMS 🔍

This repository contains the final group project developed for the **Data Mining** course  
of the Master's in Data Science & Advanced Analytics at **NOVA IMS**.

## 📁 Project Overview

We conducted an end-to-end data mining process using clustering techniques to extract insights from real-world data. The workflow included:

- 🧼 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔍 Application of clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- 📈 Result interpretation and visualization
- 📝 Reporting of key findings

## 🧠 Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Main Objectives

- Identify natural groupings and patterns in the data
- Apply and compare clustering algorithms
- Build a business-oriented interpretation of data mining results

## 👥 Contributors

This project was developed by Group 24 during the academic year 2023/2024  
as part of the Master's in Data Science & Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS.
